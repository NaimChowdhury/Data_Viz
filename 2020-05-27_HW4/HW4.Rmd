## 1. Faithful Scatterplot
Create a shiny app that shows, in the mainpanel of a sidebar layout, a scatterplot of the waiting time (on the y-axis) against the eruption time (on the x-axis), and where the user can select, in the sidebarpanel
  
  i) the color of the dots appearing in the scatterplot from a drop-down menu that has at least four options for different colors,
  
  ii) the shape of the plotting symbols to be either dots, squares or triangles.
  
The scatterplot should respond to the selection of these two inputs by plotting the choosen color and symbol.

Upload, to Canvas, both the `ui.r` and `server.r` file of your app. Here are the `ui.r` and `server.r` code we created at the end of class yesterday:

**ui.r:**
```
library(shiny)
shinyUI(
  fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        sliderInput("bins",
                    "Number of Bins:",
                    min = 1,
                    max = 100,
                    value = 37),
        radioButtons("color", "Choose Color", 
                     choices = list(Red="red",Blue="blue", Gray="gray"),
                     selected="blue", inline=TRUE
        )
      ),
      mainPanel(
        plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
    )
  )
)
```


**server.r:**
```
library(shiny)
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful[, 2]
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    p <- hist(x, breaks = bins, col = input$color, border = 'white')
    return(p)
  })
})
```
